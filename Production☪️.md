# Concepts
## Royal & Loyal Order 
A group above the Imperialist and Experialist and it embodies the abstract concept of the Superialist because 
the Superial army is only small but mixed with other government armies. It is like the Knights Templar, it is one of the groups that 
answers directly to the king, made during the Renaissance and it is quite well organized.

Here is a simple flow chart of weapons or tools used by soldiers, some are used together or just solo:
